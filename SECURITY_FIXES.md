=== Security Issues to Address ===
1. Solidity Version Issues:
   - Update contracts to use exact version 0.8.19 instead of ^0.8.19
2. Low-level Call Security:
   - Add reentrancy guards to emergencyWithdraw
   - Implement checks-effects-interactions pattern
3. State Variable Optimization:
   - Mark SecurityBase.messageCount as constant
   - Mark CrossChainMessenger state variables as immutable
4. Naming Conventions:
   - Update parameter names to follow mixedCase
