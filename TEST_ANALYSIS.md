# Test Failure Analysis

## Error Message Standardization Issues

1. MockRouter Tests:
   - Expected: "Chain not supported" -> Actual: "TestRouter: chain not supported"
   - Expected: "Invalid target address" -> Actual: "TestRouter: invalid target address"
   - Expected: "Insufficient fee" -> Actual: "TestRouter: insufficient fee"

2. RateLimiter Tests:
   - Expected: "Rate limit exceeded" -> Actual: "RateLimiter: rate limit exceeded"
   - Expected: "Rate limit exceeded for current period" -> Actual: "RateLimiter: rate limit exceeded"

3. CrossChainMessenger Tests:
   - Expected: "Invalid message format" -> Message reverted without reason
   - Expected: "Invalid token amount" -> Actual: "TestRouter: token transfers not supported"

4. Security Feature Tests:
   - Expected: "Contract paused" -> Not reverting as expected
   - Expected: "Pausable: not paused" -> Actual: "EmergencyPause: contract not paused"

## Constructor and Function Issues
1. Monitoring System:
   - "incorrect number of arguments to constructor"
   - Missing emergencyPause function in messenger contract

## Action Plan

1. Update Test Expectations:
   - Standardize all error message expectations to match new format: "{ContractName}: {message}"
   - Update all test files to expect new standardized messages

2. Fix Constructor Issues:
   - Review and fix constructor argument handling in Monitoring System
   - Add missing emergencyPause functionality

3. Fix Security Features:
   - Implement proper pause functionality
   - Standardize pause-related error messages

4. Update Documentation:
   - Document all standardized error messages
   - Update integration guides with new error handling expectations

Priority: Start with test expectation updates as they affect the most files and are causing the majority of failures.
